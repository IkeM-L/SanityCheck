Detects a mismatch between code comments and functionality
<p>
    Uses a LLM configured in the extension settings to give you a 'sanity check' for mismatches between code logic and comments.

<pre><code>
// automatically highlighted according to inspection registration 'language' attribute
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>Text after this comment will only be shown in the settings of the inspection.</p>

<p>To open related settings directly from the description, add a link with `settings://$` optionally followed by `?$` to
